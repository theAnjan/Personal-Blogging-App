Day-4
On Creating Systems
I value self-discipline, but creating systems that make it impossible to misbehave is more reliable than self-control.

Sitting infront of a delicious food and staring for hours without eating is not self-discipline. They think of resisting temptations as being like a knight defending his kingdom against invader.
The best way to protect yourself against temptations is to avoid them and for that old preparation is more valuable than self-control. Prepare yourself for difficult situations by putting up roadblocks ahead of time, when your resolve isn't being tested. Your self-control system will do heavy lifting for you, leaving your reserves of self-discipline to be used for the unplanned situations, when they arise.
