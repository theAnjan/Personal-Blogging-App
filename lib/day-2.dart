Day-2
On Your Choices
Your choices are made in a moment, but their consequences will transcend a lifetime.

Sleep in and barely get to work on time or wake up at 5 am to work on your side business before going to work at your day job? Stop trying the moment you get rejected or swallow your pride and keep going despite hearing 'no' dozen of times?
It takes only a moment to make the wrong choice and jeopardize your future. What feels like an insignificant today can have a great, lasting impact on your future.
Each choice sets a precedent and when you make the same wrong choice several times in a row, it becomes your standard modus operandi.
While one hamburger every now and then isn't likely to ruin-your overall efforts to lose weight, underestimating the impact of repeatedly  making wrong choice can profoundly affect you over the course of the rest of your life.
Each time you're faced with a decision between exerting self-discipline and taking it easy, remind yourself that the choice you're making today doesn't affect the present moment alone. A momentary decision can (and oftern will) reverberate for many years or even decades into future.
