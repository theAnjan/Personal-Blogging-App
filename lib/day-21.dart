On the Importance of Habits.
Success is actually a short race-a sprint fueled by discipline just long enough for habit to kick in and take over.

Habits are like magical power. The moment they kickin, you no longer need more than perhaps a modicum of self-discipline every now and then to perform same action on regular basis. What originally was extremely difficult is now something you do automatically, with little thought or willpower.
When something becomes a part of your routine, resistance drops to nearly zero. The challenging part is forming a new habit. It takes around 18-254 days with 66 as average. When working on your goals, remind yourself that it's first months that will be the hardest.
Once proper habits kick in, things will get easier.
Remember that in the long term, only habits-and their subsequent permanent changes in lifestyle and identity-can ensure lasting success.
Consequently, its key to think in terms of life long routines.
As long as it is not a habit,you will revert back to inactivity, old days, PANAUTIS.
Analyse your goals and assess whether your plans employ self-discipline to help you build a habit or if you're using self control as a means of temporarily sustaining an impermanent change.Change an impermanent change.
