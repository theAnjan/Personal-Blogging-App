Week 9 Day 57
On Two Types of Happiness

happiness you get from succumbing to a temptation is inferior.
When all of your decision are aligned toward a better future(even if you're suffering at times because things don't go as planned or it's hard to maintain self discipline), you wake up excited and full of energy.

#When a person can't find a deep sense of meaning they distract themselves with Pleasure.
