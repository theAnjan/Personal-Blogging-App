On Being a Human
Willpower- capacity to restrain our impulses resist temptaton- do what's right and good in long run rather what we want to do right now.

Humans have the capacity to act against their urges in exchange for a better future. Unfortunately, many people live by the principle of "if it feels good, do it and if it does'nt , don't do it."
Caving into your temptations whenever you feel them emerge is like relinquishing your humanity in a way. As an intelligent human being, you have an ability- and I daresay an obligation - to make decisions that are based on rational thinking, not on your instincts alone.
Strive to be a better human and embrace your humanity by exercising your "willpower muscle" instead of succumbing to your most primal(and least helpful for your long-term goals) part of the brain. Your most primal instincts may provide temporary comfort, but seldom are good for the long term, except when there is a direct threat to your survival.
